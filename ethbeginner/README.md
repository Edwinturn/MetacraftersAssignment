# Remix Tutorial for Eddycoin Smart Contract

This tutorial will guide you through using the Remix IDE to deploy and interact with the Eddycoin smart contract.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Access to a web browser.
2. An internet connection.

## Getting Started

1. Open your web browser and navigate to Remix: [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. In the Remix IDE, create a new file named "eddycoin.sol."

3. Copy and paste the provided Eddycoin smart contract code into the "eddycoin.sol" file.

4. You can now compile the smart contract by following the steps in Remix.

5. Once the contract is successfully compiled, switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

6. In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" section, you'll see the "Deploy" button next to your contract. Click "Deploy" to deploy the smart contract to a local or test Ethereum network.

7. After deploying the contract, you can interact with it by calling the `mint` and `burn` functions, passing the required parameters.

8. To check the status and balances, you can use the public variables `tokenName`, `tokenAbbrv`, `totalSupply`, and `balances`.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully deployed and interacted with the Eddycoin smart contract using Remix. Feel free to explore more features of Remix and experiment with this simple contract.
